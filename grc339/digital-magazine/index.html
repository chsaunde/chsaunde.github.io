                                    Climate change is a significant factor contributing to the decline in pollinator populations. The warming of the planet and changes in weather patterns are altering the synchrony between flowering plants and their pollinators, causing nutritional stress. Radical shifts in temperature, droughts, and floods are disrupting native ranges for pollinators, making ecosystems unsuitable for the processes needed to sustain populations, such as overwinter hibernation, spring nest establishment, and reproduction. In the case of honey bees, the warmer temperatures in late fall and winter that are occurring with greater frequency in northern latitudes have made it increasingly difficult to reduce winter colony losses. This is because the warmer fall and winter temperatures are extending the period when bees are foraging. This disrupts the colony age structure and resource utilization, enabling Varroa mites to migrate among colonies on foragers, spreading this parasite and the viruses it transmits throughout apiaries.

                                <p>
                                    Honey bees and other pollinators are critically important to securing the nations food supply and providing ecosystem services that insure plant diversity, soil stability, and species richness. Fruit and seed yields increase when many bee species are present, whether in undisturbed ecosystems or in crops such as apples or almonds, where pollination by both honey bees and native bees generates greater yields and higher quality fruit. There are more than 4,000 species of bees in the United States, with many bumble bee and solitary bee species remaining to be described and life histories understood.

                        <p>It is the goal of every beekeeper to maintain healthy, productive colonies. This can only be accomplished by reducing the frequency and prevalence of disease within beehives. The following is an outline of recommendations for detecting and treating colonies for economically important parasites and pathogens of honey bees so that beekeepers may achieve this goal, and do so in a sustainable way for the long-term health of their colonies.

                                    In 2017, the United States had 2.88 million honey bee colonies, down
12 percent from the record high 3.28 million colonies in 2012, but down
less than 1 percent from 2007. Fig. 1 shows number of colonies since 1969;
similar data are available going back to 1900. Fig. 2 shows that colony losses
and gains occur seasonally. The greatest losses occur in the fall and winter
quarters that start in October and January.

                                    Kallie Moore, the University of Montanas Fossil Librarian, discusses the intricacies of geologic climate change. By understanding the geological time scale, we can gain insight into the geologic science behind climate change, how climate change results in mass extinctions, and what climate change means for us today.

                                    As the worlds most effective pollinators, bees are responsible for nearly one in three bites of food we eat. Their pollination services also help many of the worlds flowering plants to reproduce, supporting biodiversity and keeping our natural ecosystems healthy. But widespread pesticide use, habitat loss, climate change and parasites threaten bee health and populations. Since 2016, nine native bee species have been declared endangered in the U.S., including the rusty patched bumblebee which was once abundant in over half the country.

                                    Bees pollinate our fields, orchards and gardens, providing nearly one-third of the food we eat. They bring sweetness to our lives. But bees face serious threats and need our help. Beesponsible is the way we keep them healthy and around.

                                    Image result for bees and weather
Yes, perhaps, bees can predict the weather. The study found that the honey bees, on days prior to rainy days, spent more time out of the hive foraging for honey as compared to days where rain was not forecast the next day. In, short, perhaps, bees might have some skill in sensing the atmospheric changes ahead of rain.
