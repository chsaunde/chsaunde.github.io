                                <p>Climate change is a significant factor contributing to the decline in pollinator populations. The warming of the planet and changes in weather patterns are altering the synchrony between flowering plants and their pollinators, causing nutritional stress. Radical shifts in temperature, droughts, and floods are disrupting native ranges for pollinators, making ecosystems unsuitable for the processes needed to sustain populations, such as overwinter hibernation, spring nest establishment, and reproduction. In the case of honey bees, the warmer temperatures in late fall and winter that are occurring with greater frequency in northern latitudes have made it increasingly difficult to reduce winter colony losses. This is because the warmer fall and winter temperatures are extending the period when bees are foraging. This disrupts the colony age structure and resource utilization, enabling Varroa mites to migrate among colonies on foragers, spreading this parasite and the viruses it transmits throughout apiaries.</p>
                               
                                <p> In Logan, UT, the ARS Pollinating Insect-Biology, Management, Systematics Research Unit is the home of the U.S. National Pollinating Insect Collection. Scientists there are investigating other bee species that can be managed for pollination and learning how multiple species are needed for pollination of our crops and natural ecosystems. For bumblebees and managed solitary bee species, research is defining how climate is affecting bee nutrition, development, reproduction, and survival. The research will increase our understanding of how variable climate impacts different bee species and direct the next steps for beekeepers and managers to help their bees survive these challenges.</p>

                                <p>Research conducted by Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists is focused on understanding the impact of a changing climate on bee health and survival and finding solutions to reduce pollinator losses. In the spirit of delivering cutting-edge scientific tools and innovative solutions, scientists at the ARS Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, AZ, are developing management schemes for overwintering honey bee hives in cold-storage facilities to reduce the impact of Varroa mites and nutritional stress and increase colony survival. Scientists there also are studying how environmental factors affect the nutrients in pollen and nectar and how growing conditions can be managed to optimize the nutritional quality of these food sources.</p>

                                <p>As average monthly temperatures rise, flowers bloom earlier in the spring, creating a potential mismatch in seasonal timing between when flowers produce pollen and when bees are ready to feed on that pollen. Even a small mismatch of three to six days could negatively affect bees health, making them less likely to reproduce and less resistant to predators and parasites.</p>

                                    Climate change is causing habitat loss as bees fail to migrate to cooler areas and establish new hives. A recent study on bumblebee migrations found that bee territories have shrunk by nearly 200 miles in North America and Europe. In South Africa, CI is keeping important pollinator habitat intact and helping to ensure future food security there.

                                    About one out of every three bites of food is made possible by bees and other pollinators in the United States alone, honeybees pollinate $15 billion worth of crops each year. But the worlds honeybees are in steep decline, with 10 million hives disappearing just in the past three years. Not having honey is the least of our problems.
