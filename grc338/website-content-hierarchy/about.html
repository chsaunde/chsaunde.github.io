                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    What started as two people behind an espresso machine in downtown Solvang has grown into a full-scale coffee roastery, bakery and passionate team of people who love service and thrive on making days. We believe that specialty coffee is for everyone, and should be accessible, approachable and fun. It is our privilege to find beautiful coffees and roast them and serve them in our hometown of Solvang. If you are in town, stop by and say hi!

                <p>While we are the last hands that touch these coffees, we cannot claim to be solely responsible for their deliciousness. Coffee is the product of many human beings hard work: from farm to mill to the exporter to roaster; this chain works when we are all invested in each other. We are committed to working with importing and exporting partners that are invested in the long-term success of the coffee producers.
